Write an indexed for loop to fill an array called prime such that element prime[0]

contains the first prime number, prime[1] the second prime number, and so on. The prime numbers (six in total) will be provided by the user using "scanf" within the for loop. Finally calculate and display the sum of those six prime numbers.
